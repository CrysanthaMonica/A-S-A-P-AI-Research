## Overview
The SMARTPRICINGAPP, known as A-S-A-P ("As Soon As Pay"), is an AI-powered application designed to assist traditional merchants by enhancing their pricing strategies through real-time negotiations and customer interactions. The app aims to level the playing field for local merchants in the face of growing competition from online commerce, providing a modern toolset for effective and fair pricing.

## Abstract
This study addresses the challenges faced by traditional merchants due to the rise of online platforms, leading to decreased foot traffic and sales. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the A-S-A-P application is proposed to optimize pricing strategies, helping merchants offer competitive yet fair prices. Using interviews and surveys, data has been gathered to pinpoint key challenges such as platform friction, market diversification, and competition. The anticipated solution is expected to boost sales and enhance merchant profitability through advanced pricing models and negotiation features.

## Introduction
As e-commerce continues to rise in Indonesia, traditional merchants are increasingly struggling to maintain competitiveness due to the lower pricing strategies and convenience offered by online platforms. The A-S-A-P application seeks to empower these merchants with AI tools that provide accurate pricing strategies and negotiation assistance, thereby helping them adapt to the modern retail environment.

## Literature Review
Several AI technologies, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), have shown promising results in fields like voice recognition and chatbot interaction, as seen in various studies. These models contribute to improved user interactions by enhancing speech recognition and response accuracy, which will be critical in building an efficient negotiation platform within A-S-A-P.

## Methodology
### 5.1 Related Works
The design of the A-S-A-P application focuses on aiding merchants with price negotiations through AI-powered features, such as a chatbot and voice recognition. A qualitative approach, using surveys and interviews, was employed to gather insights from potential users about their experiences and needs.

### 5.2 Chatbot
The chatbot acts as a digital assistant, providing information about products and helping merchants navigate pricing negotiations in real-time. It operates through a conversational interface, engaging with customers in both text and voice formats to facilitate smoother transactions.

### 5.3 Web API
The Web API enables A-S-A-P to integrate with external databases, such as seller records, price trends, and customer preferences. It allows seamless access to real-time data, ensuring that merchants have accurate information for decision-making.

### 5.4 Application Features
A-S-A-P integrates several key features:
- **Voice Recognition:** Facilitates natural user interactions, allowing voice-based negotiations and price adjustments.
- **Chatbot Functionality:** Engages customers and sellers in real-time conversations, guiding them through pricing strategies.
- **Flexibility:** The system adapts to multiple data sources, enhancing its ability to suggest fair and dynamic pricing.
- **User Analytics:** Provides insights based on interaction data, helping merchants refine their strategies.

## Proposed Solution
The A-S-A-P application aims to enhance traditional merchants' pricing strategies by integrating AI-driven negotiation and voice interaction tools. Its features—chatbot, voice recognition, and data integration through APIs—enable merchants to offer competitive pricing, improving their standing against e-commerce platforms.

## Expected Outcomes
- Increased competitiveness for traditional merchants through better pricing strategies.
- Enhanced interaction between sellers and buyers, making the pricing process more dynamic and transparent.
- Valuable insights for developers to continue refining the application based on user feedback.

## Further Improvements
- **AI Enhancement:** Regular updates to improve the adaptability of the AI based on market trends and user interactions.
- **UI/UX Optimization:** Ongoing refinements to make the app more intuitive for users.
- **Feature Expansion:** Adding analytics for customer behavior and more advanced pricing models.
- **Cross-Platform Availability:** Developing both mobile and web-based versions for increased accessibility.
